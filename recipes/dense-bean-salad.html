    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Made popular by TikTok create <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@violet.cooks">Violet Witchel</a>, dense bean salad has become a staple in my meal plans.
         Here is another great recipe to help you eat healthy and make meal planning easier.
         This dish gets better during the week when your vegetables have been soaking in the dressing.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Garbonzo beans, canned</li>
        <li>Black beans, canned</li>
        <li>Bell peppers (I like to use the red, yellow, and orange ones together)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chicken, you can substitute this with whatever meat or protein you like.</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
        <li>Italian Dressing</li>
        <li>Balsamic vinaigrette</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to add more ingredients or take some away. For example, I don't usually like onions, so I don't use that when I make dense bean salad for myself.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open up the can of beans. Rinse, drain, and dry them.</li>
        <li>Cook the corn, if cooking corn on the cob, then slice off the corn from the cob.</li>
        <li>Dice the vegetables and add them all together with the dry beans and corn.</li>
        <li>Add your dressing of choice.</li>
    </ol>
